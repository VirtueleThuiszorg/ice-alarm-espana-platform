# PENDING_FOR_LEE.md — handover

> **This file is the handover from the 5 September 2026 autonomous run.** Claude Code cannot

> Everything it merged that needs one of those is listed here, in order.

> **Read this before `supabase db push`.**

## 1. Migrations merged but NOT in production

`supabase/migrations/APPLIED_TO_PROD.txt` is the record of what production has. **Claude Code
has appended nothing to it** — it cannot apply migrations, so claiming they were applied would
make the manifest lie, and the drift gate (#164) depends on that manifest being true.

**Apply in this order, then append each filename to `APPLIED_TO_PROD.txt` and merge that.**

| # | Migration | What it does | Reversible |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `20260905100000_staff_delete_fk_rules.sql` | Every **nullable** FK pointing at `staff`/`auth.users` becomes `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so a staff member can be deleted without destroying audit history. Also converts the `member_update_tokens` attribution CHECK into a trigger — see D-1 | Yes, block written out in the file |

> After pushing: `git pull`, append the filenames above to `APPLIED_TO_PROD.txt`, commit, merge.
> The drift gate will fail the next migration-bearing PR until you do.

## 2. Secrets, settings and approvals only Lee can do

| # | Action | Where | Why it matters | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Rotate the `sb_secret_` key** that was pasted into chat | Supabase → Project Settings → API Keys | A service-role key in a chat log is a live credential | ⬜ |
| S2 | **Approve the Twilio WhatsApp sender** | Twilio console | D8's opt-in link and D7's WhatsApp channel cannot send until approved. **Has its own clock — start early** | ⬜ |
| S3 | **Verify `icealarm.es` with Resend**, then edit the existing SPF record (one record only), publish DKIM + DMARC | Resend + DNS | Email channel stays OFF until this delivers. Nothing built this run depends on email | ⬜ |
| S4 | **Set `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`** or retire the Gmail transport in favour of Resend | Supabase → Edge Function secrets | `send-member-update-request` currently fails on the missing secret | ⬜ |
| S5 | **Disconnect the stale Vercel project** `care-conneqt-platform` (under `lee-wakemans-projects`) | Vercel | It fails on **every** PR because the repo was renamed. The live project `ice-alarm-espana-platform` (under `virtuele-thuiszorg`) deploys fine. Right now every PR shows a red X that means nothing — which is how a real red X gets ignored | ⬜ |

## 2b. Decisions Lee needs to make — found while building, deliberately NOT fixed

### D-1 — `members.user_id` is nullable **and** `ON DELETE CASCADE`

Deleting an `auth.users` row deletes the **entire member record** — and with it, by their own
cascades, that person's `medical_information`, `emergency_contacts`, `devices`, `alerts` and
`subscription`.

The column being **nullable** proves a member can exist without a login (staff-created members
do). So `SET NULL` — *"they no longer have a login; they are still a member"* — is available and
is probably the safer semantic on a life-safety product.

**Not changed**, because it is an **erasure-policy** decision rather than an audit fix:
cascading may be exactly what GDPR erasure is meant to do. Deciding it silently inside a PR
about staff deletion would be the wrong way to decide it. The RLS harness excludes it **by
name**, with a control assertion that fails if a *second* nullable cascade ever appears — so the
exclusion cannot quietly grow into a blanket.

**Question: should deleting a login delete the member, or orphan them?**

### D-2 — four `NOT NULL` staff FKs still block deletion

`SET NULL` is impossible on a `NOT NULL` column, so these were left alone rather than guessed at:

| Table | Column |
|---|---|
| `ticket_comments` | `staff_id` |
| `staff_shift_covers` | `original_staff_id` |
| `staff_shift_covers` | `cover_staff_id` |
| `internal_tickets` | `created_by` |

Each needs its own answer: CASCADE (delete the comment with its author?), RESTRICT (refuse until
the shift is reassigned — arguably right for `staff_shift_covers`), or make the column nullable
first. **A departing staff member with an open shift cover still cannot be deleted** until this
is settled.

### D-3 — the migration drift gate blocks this run to one migration at a time

The gate I built in #164 fails a PR that adds a migration while an **earlier one is still
unapplied**. That is exactly right in normal operation. In this run it means: once migration 1
above is merged, **every later migration-bearing PR fails CI until you push and update the
manifest.**

I have not weakened the gate to get around my own run — that is precisely the "turn the gate off
because it is inconvenient" failure it was built to prevent. Instead, later migration-bearing
work is **prepared, gated on its own merits, and left OPEN** with the reason stated, listed in
§5. One `supabase db push` plus one manifest commit unblocks all of them at once.

## 3. Per-channel flags (D7) — turn on only when proven

Each channel is switched on independently in `system_settings`, **default OFF**. A channel that
is off is skipped and logged, never silently failed.

| Channel | Flag | Turn on when |
|---|---|---|
| SMS | `notify_channel_sms` | **Proven today — may be ON** |
| Email | `notify_channel_email` | After S3 verifies and a test message actually arrives |
| WhatsApp | `notify_channel_whatsapp` | After S2 approves the sender |

---

## 4. Tests only a human can run

1. **Sign up through `/join` with a real card.** Watch: webhook activates → readiness queue
   shows you → header notice shows → add a contact → allocate a pendant → walk the six states →
   test call → `tested`. **Refund.** That one pass proves WP2, WP3 and the payment path together.
2. **The D5 escalation ruling** — before the SOS drill.
3. **The SOS drill itself**, with Travis and Mary.

## 5. PRs left OPEN for Lee, deliberately

| PR | Why it is open |
|---|---|
| _(none yet this run)_ | |

> Per the brief: any PR touching `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook` or
> `supabase/functions/create-checkout` stays open. A broken webhook means no member ever
> activates, and it fails **silently**.
